# MekongSedGHG_EF_paper
The repository contains the code, input and output data used in the paper Tangi, M., Schmitt, R., Almeida, R., Bossi, S., Flecker, A., Sala, F., and Castelletti, A. - "Robust hydropower planning balances energy generation, carbon emissions and sediment connectivity in the Mekong river basin"

----

The data are divided into five folders

    Folder "inputs" contains the input used for the simulations, including the Mekong River network and dam location and features;
    Folder "code" contains all the scripts used to extract the paper's results and generate the paper's figures;
    Folder "results" contains the outputs of the analysis described in the paper, in .mat format.

The scripts use the BORG Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to extract the results. The code to run the BORG MOEA is available on request from http://borgmoea.org/
